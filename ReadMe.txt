Hi, Asad, i hope you are doing well, i have delivered you project with database.

You need to import database backup file into your Microsoft SQL Management Studio

Database backup file can be find in Database folder of Project.

After this you need to changes SQL Connection String into Web.config file
You done this, start your project into browser.
